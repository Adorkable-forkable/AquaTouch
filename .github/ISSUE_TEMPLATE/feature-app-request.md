Aquatouch is discontinued as I'd like to continue onto creating more great things now that the touchbar is being phased out!
This includes work for a new touchbar replacement idea that works with any mac.

You can still request an application, though it is unlikley to be added into AquaTouch. Perhaps I could look into it and implement it into the thing that would replace AquaTouch!

If you're requesting a touchbar for a new app, please explain your workflow, list possible things to include or submit a preset you've made yourself to get me started!
