This repository is not for contributing / co-developing yet.

If you'd like to contribute, by adding new features or help add a new app:

- Download a copy of AQT from the official thread, then add your changes. 
- When you feel like your modifications are good for AQT, message me over at the forum (https://community.folivora.ai/u/yuuiko/) or make a new issue and we can continue from there.
- If I see the changes as relavant to the wider community, I'll touchup your creation and merge it into AQT for all to use!
