the Spotify volume controle level isn't updating when controlling a connected (external) device.
if you start controlling the connected device volume on Touch Bar it will directly update to the Touch Bar set level (which sometimes leads to extremely loud music).
if you use the Spotify app to change volume the Touch Bar doesn't update until you touch it again and it will set Touch Bar volume as app volume.
idea: on touch(down) request the current level and set slider level accordingly, so it won't give huge volume changes due to failed / level update problems?
