<h2>Features, Tips and Tricks for your AquaTouch Usage.</h2>
<h3> Activating Aqua Touch </h3>
<p>Unlike some other Better Touch Tool Presets, AquaTouch allows you to easily switch between the native controls and AquaTouch quickly. If supported, Apps that don't have a native TouchBar set will show up for you automatically.<br>
<br>
Tap the BTT button to bring AquaTouch up, and hold the Apps button in the control strip (explained below) or a green BTT button to get back to the app's native TouchBar set.
<!-- The Better Touch Tool icon changes colour to let you know when AquaTouch is Activated. <br> -->
  <!-- <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/Br5tZ/a08414cbca.png" /> - Green means AquaTouch is displaying it’s buttons and functions.<br> -->
  <!-- <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/Br5A2/aa2f5eab3a.png" /> - Blue means that the Quick Menu is showing. - See Quick Menu below to learn more about this. --></p><br>

<h3> Volume, Brightness and Keyboard Backlight Controls </h3>
  <p>AquaTouch uses Gestures in the TouchBar to control Volume, Brightness and Keyboard Backlight. <br>
<br>Here are the controls:<br>
- Two finger slide: Volume<br>
- Three finger slide: Brightness<br>
- Four finger slide: Keyboard Brightness<br>
<br>
Why not try these gestures in the TouchBar now?<br>
<br>
Note: This only works when BTT is active and showing an AquaTouch set, meaning you need to open AquaTouch before setting the brightness or volume. This is currently a limitation with using gestures, but this is worthy trade-off for more space and fiddling with the bar to set them.</p>
<br>

<h3> AquaTouch Control Strip </h3>
<p>The four buttons on the right of the touch bar is AquaTouch's control strip. It's always displayed on the right of the touch bar for you to use.<br>
<br>
The control strip gives you quick access to tools you use most. You can check and control any music or videos playing, see your calendar and reminders, toggle system controls and use app shortcuts easily.<br>
<br>
Here are the four buttons, and what they do: <br>
<strong>Play:</strong> Tap this button to open up media controls and Now Playing widgets. If a supported app is playing media, they will show up here!<br>
<strong>Calendar:</strong> Tap to check your claendar and reminders. You can also view the weather and time here.<br>
<strong>Switches:</strong> Open this up to set system controls such as NightShift or sleep your computer. There's a connectivity pallete to the right that allows you to connect to AirPods, or toggle WiFi.<br>
<strong>Apps:</strong> Tap this group to open up an app switcher to the left, and do frequently used tasks with one button. You can hold command here to quit apps with a touch, too.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you can hold the buttons to:<br>
<strong>Play:</strong> Hold to Play/Pause Media.<br>
<strong>Calendar:</strong> Open Notification Centre<br>
<strong>Switches:</strong> Call Siri<br>
<strong>Apps:</strong> Close the BTT Touch Bar<br>
<br>
Thanks to GoldenChaos and his BTT preset ‘GoldenChaos-BTT’ for the widgets! (I have modified them, and permission of use was granted by GoldenChaos.)<br>

<h3> Holdable Buttons </h3>
  <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAaa5/7e3ca40e59.png" />  <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAafe/9b50be6577.png" />
<p>Holdable Buttons are indicated by a small dot in it’s corner.
Hold any holdable button to see more options related to that button.<br>
<br>
You can also hold buttons in the Control Strip, and the buttons within it too. (These are not noted by dots due to BTT limitations / aesthetics)
Holding any Now Playing widget in the Play or Calendar Control Strip launches the corresponding app or brings it to the front.<br>
Holding the connectivity palette in the Switches Control Strip will expand it and show more controls.<br>
</p><br>

<h3> Safari Widgets </h3>
  <!-- <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAaa5/7e3ca40e59.png" />  <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAafe/9b50be6577.png" /> -->
<p>AquaTouch supports many apps, and it even supports websites!<br>
If you visit a supported website in Safari, you'll notice an additional button is added to Safari's AQT set.<br>
The AquaTouch Bar should open when you visit a supported website, simply tap the website's button (that's added into the bar) to bring up controls.<br>
<br>
Currently Supported Sites:<br>
- YouTube<br>
- Google Docs<br>
- Google Drive<br>
- Kahoot.it <br>
<br>
</p><br>

<h3> Bring up Window Snapping </h3>
  <!-- <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAaa5/7e3ca40e59.png" />  <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAafe/9b50be6577.png" /> -->
<p>Easily snap windows to left or right halves of the screen, or any corner.<br>
<br>
Simply right click on the green window button and click the position you want to snap to.<br>
Right click the yellow window button to restore the old size.
</p><br>

<h3> Click Pulse </h3>
<p>Some apps have a ‘Click Pulse’ tool which allows you to click an array of buttons like checkboxes and ‘show layer’ buttons easily. <br>
Hold the ‘Hold’ button and AquaTouch will click the mouse rhythmically for you. Hover over the buttons or checkboxes to click while you move the mouse to the next item. <br>
<br>
This can be useful to select multiple layers in Photoshop, Illustrator and selecting media to sync in iTunes.<br>
<br>
Try it here:
<form action="btt://trigger_named/?trigger_name=SETUP_showClickPulse&closeFloatingHTMLMenu=0">
   <input type="submit" value="Show Click Pulse" /><input type="checkbox" value="1" checked><input type="checkbox" value="1" checked><input type="checkbox" value="1"><input type="checkbox" value="1"><input type="checkbox" value="1"><input type="checkbox" value=“1”><input type="checkbox" value="1"><input type="checkbox" value="1">
</form>
</p><br>

<h3> PasteCells </h3>
  <!-- <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAaa5/7e3ca40e59.png" />  <img alt="Ensure you have an internet connection to load this image!" src="https://puu.sh/BAafe/9b50be6577.png" /> -->
<p>Some apps have elements in their TouchBar set called “PasteCells”. It’s an original innovation of AquaTouch that allows you to save snippets of code or text into the TouchBar to easily paste them into your document.

• Hold a PasteCell to save text into it.
• Tap a PasteCell to paste it’s contents into your document.
</p><br>

<h3> AQT Advanced Customisation </h3>
<p>In Addition to the ‘AQT Settings’ accessed in the TouchBar below, next to the Using AquaTouch button, you can further customise the feel and function of some elements of AQT.<br>
<br>
How to Customise AQT - Advanced<br>
1. Open the Better Touch Tool Window. <br>
2. Head to the 'Other' tab<br>
3. You'll see a AQT CUSTOM PREFERENCES section. Select the item you wish to Customise<br>
4. Change/tweak the 'Predifined Action' to what you wish. For haptic options, click the gear icon next to the "Predifined Action" dropdown.<br>
<br>
Some things you can change at the moment: <br>
- Haptic Feedback Style<br>
- Control Strip Hold Actions<br>
<br>
- More to be added soon.

</style>
<br>

<h3> Notes </h3>
<p>You can always come back and see this window by launching the Better Touch Tool window. <br>
<br>
This preset is very much in progress, so some buttons and functions may not run as smooth as expected. Make sure you check and subscribe to the AQT online thread for updates too, You don't want to miss out on new features.<br>
I’ll keep an eye out for feedback and suggestions, so if you’d like to report an issue, check for updates, request a feature or contribute to this preset then please visit <a href="btt://trigger_named/?trigger_name=SETUP_showForumThread&closeFloatingHTMLMenu=0">the AquaTouch Forum Thread</a>. <br>
I appreciate your help! <br>
<br>
Thanks for using this preset. Let’s work together to improve it!<br>
