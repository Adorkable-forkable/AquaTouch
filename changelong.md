**Changelog v3.5.3** (Last Edit: 20 SEP 2019)

----
**BIG Performance Optimisations**
- Optimise the QuickShedules button (in the QuickStrip).
- Calendar icon in the CS is now more efficient when highlighting is turned off.
- Optimise the "No Apps Playing" message with the QuickPlay widgets

----
**New Features**

New External Disks widgets!
- supports up to 5 disks. Find them in the new finder set and in Quickctions. EDIT: UNSTABLE, MAY NOT COME TO FINAL.

Finder is now a replacement set!
- I combined my own finder native touchbar and AQT's extra tools. I wanted to add tags because I use it often but that doesn't seem feasable yet.

Preview is now a replacement set!
- I'm quite proud of this one!
Featuring three tabs, "View", "Edit" and "Markup", enabling you to streamline your editing and scribbling better. 
Switches layouts based on the file type that is open; Document-related controls won't show up for an image and vice versa, while other controls specific to documents or images are added. Switching also doesn't switch the tabs! Seems normal but was interesting to implement.

Brave browser added.
- Literal copy-paste from safari. No web widgets yet. If I feel like it then I might add support, Brave seems to support scripting.

Kahoot.it Web Widget
- Keyboard shortcuts for kahoot.it web widget because I kept loosing :( hopefully my new weapons will allow me to beat my class :‚é§

Notes
- Added continuity camera button to notes as an extension set. Useful for lectures - use your iPhone as a camera for your Mac to take pictures that instantly show up in notes.

New Github Desktop Client TouchBar
- Big push/pull button, and shortcuts to view repo in the Finder, Web or Terminal.

----
**Quality Improvements**

QuickMedia
- Main Media controls (grey, leftmost in the QuickMedia) now displays the icon of the app that they will control.
- Added back the "No supported apps playing currently" message.

Spotify
- Genius button now Highlights and automatically switches back to Spotify on error.

iTunes
- Shuffle and Repeat buttons scroll away so more content can be seen while scrolled.

YouTube Web Widget (Safari)
- Youtube Widget will now give prompts to enable scripting for websites. You can also tap the tip to let AQT set the stuff for you.

Google Mail Web Widget
- Should now show a setup tip noting that keyboard shortcuts need to be turned on in Gmail settings.

QuickControls
- TrueTone and NightShift buttons should now highlight if on.

----
