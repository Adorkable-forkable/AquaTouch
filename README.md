REPOSITORY NOT FOR COLLAB YET. <br>
Feel free to add issues and follow progress, but this repository is not ready for collaboration yet.
No plans to support collaboration through git yet. Havne't got my head wrapped around how this system works. If you have a contribution, download a copy of AQT and then PM me or make a new issue so I can merge it in!

### See [projects](https://github.com/yuuiko/AquaTouch/projects/1) tab for progress logs.
